## Grade Scale Implementation

Following the API specification:
- A+ (85-100): Excellent - 4.3 GPA points
- A (80-84): Very Good - 4.0 GPA points
- A- (75-79): Good - 3.7 GPA points
- B+ (70-74): Above Average - 3.3 GPA points
- B (65-69): Average - 3.0 GPA points
- B- (60-64): Below Average - 2.7 GPA points
- C+ (55-59): Satisfactory - 2.3 GPA points
- C (50-54): Pass - 2.0 GPA points
- C- (45-49): Marginal Pass - 1.7 GPA points
- D (40-44): Poor - 1.0 GPA points
- F (0-39): Fail - 0.0 GPA points

## Authentication & Security
