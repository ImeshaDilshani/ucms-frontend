## üîç Common Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Duplicate Registration Prevention
**Steps:**
1. Register for a course
2. Try to register for the same course again
**Expected:** Error message preventing duplicate registration

### Test Case 2: Course Capacity Limits
**Steps:**
1. Create a course with maxEnrollments = 1
2. Have two students try to register
**Expected:** Second student gets "course full" error

### Test Case 3: Registration Status Check
**Steps:**
1. Register for a course as student
2. Check registration status via API
**Expected:** Returns `true` for registered course, `false` for others

### Test Case 4: Unregistration
**Steps:**
1. Register for a course
2. Unregister from the course
3. Check if course is available for enrollment again
**Expected:** Course becomes available again

## üêõ Debugging Guide

### Frontend Issues

#### Issue: API calls failing
**Check:**
1. Browser Network tab for failed requests
2. Console for error messages
3. Backend server is running on correct port

#### Issue: Authentication errors
**Check:**
1. localStorage for valid JWT token
2. Token expiration
3. User role permissions

#### Issue: UI not updating after API calls
**Check:**
1. State management in React components
2. useEffect dependencies
3. Error handling in API calls

### Backend Issues

#### Issue: CORS errors
**Solution:** Ensure CORS is configured to allow frontend origin

#### Issue: 401 Unauthorized
**Solution:** Check JWT token validity and user authentication

#### Issue: 404 Not Found
**Solution:** Verify API endpoints match the documented paths

  }
]
```

## üéØ Performance Testing

### Load Testing Registration System
1. Create multiple student accounts
2. Simultaneously register for the same course
3. Monitor system performance and data consistency

### Stress Testing API Endpoints
1. Use the API testing panel to make rapid consecutive calls
2. Monitor response times and error rates
3. Check for memory leaks or performance degradation
